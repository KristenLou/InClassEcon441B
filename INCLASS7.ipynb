      "1. Alan Turing was not the first person to conduct substantial research around machine intelligence. He was indeed a pioneer in the field, but there were also other crucial contributors.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. The statement that \"Funding and interest vastly increased after 2012 when deep learning surpassed all previous AI techniques\" can be misleading. While deep learning did play a significant role in sparking interest in AI, asserting that it surpassed all previous techniques may not be true. Other techniques like reinforcement learning, decision trees also played a crucial role.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. The text implies that AI is primarily an American innovation with the line - \"The AI spring of the early 2020s, with companies, universities, and laboratories overwhelmingly based in the United States pioneering significant advances in artificial intelligence.\" This might be misleading as AI research and development is a global effort with significant contribution from Europe, Asia and elsewhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "4. The statement describing formal knowledge representations suggests they are used in \"clinical decision support.\" This is not universally true, as the use of AI in direct clinical decision support is still somewhat controversial and not well-integrated in many clinical settings.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. The text regarding agents - \"The decision making agent assigns a number to each situation (called the \"utility\") that measures how much the agent prefers it.\" In decision theory, Utility isn't necessarily a measure of 'preference', but rather identifies the 'value' or 'benefit' that choosing a specific decision brings to the agent.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. The text \"The agent learns to choose the best response by trial and error\" oversimplifies the complex process of reinforcement learning, where rewards and punishments are used to reinforce certain behavior but the learning process involves more sophisticated strategies and techniques than just \"trial and error\". \n",
      "\n",

UCLA was created in 1919 as a southern branch of the University of California, not the State Normal School.\n",
